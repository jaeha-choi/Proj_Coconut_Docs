# Capstone Report 1

## Environment Setup

- **Version control**
  - Server: https://github.com/jaeha-choi/Proj_Coconut_Server
  - Desktop: https://github.com/jaeha-choi/Proj_Coconut_Desktop
  - Server/Desktop Utility: https://github.com/jaeha-choi/Proj_Coconut_Utility
      - The utility is shared between Server and Desktop implementations, as both projects will use Go as a primary language. This project is part of the Server and Desktop repository as a subtree.
  - Mobile: https://github.com/jaeha-choi/Proj_Coconut_Mobile
- **Project Kanban Board**
    - Project Board: https://github.com/users/jaeha-choi/projects/
- **Code Coverage Page**
    - Server: https://app.codecov.io/gh/jaeha-choi/Proj_Coconut_Server
    - Server/Desktop Utility: https://app.codecov.io/gh/jaeha-choi/Proj_Coconut_Utility
    - Code coverage page will be added for Desktop and Mobile versions once we have any
       method to test.

## Programming

- **Server**
    ◦ Working on listener
- **Utility**
    ◦ Working on Send/Receive packets

We have set up environments to allow us to work as a group. Version control enables us to handle
conflicts, code history, merges. Kanban board helps us to keep track of our progress. We set up code
coverage mostly to prevent mistakes and ensure that the code is fully functional in every commit we
push to the master branch and stable branch. We believe that code coverage and version control will
also save time when it comes to debugging, as we can notice the issue as soon as continuous integration
raises errors.

We also started to work on the server implementation.
